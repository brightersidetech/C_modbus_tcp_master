## C Implementation of Modbus TCP Master

Ths is an Implementation of Modbus TCP Master in C. The Implementation uses the libmodbus library from https://libmodbus.org/ .
The implemetation creates a Modbus TCP Master Interface to Read data from a slave Device Registers and also write back data to the slave device Modbus Registers

### Prerequisites
1. You will need to install the ```libmodbus``` Library from https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus.
2. You will als need to install extra tools and libraries that support the libmodbus library. List of tools and libraries and installation procedure can be found from the same link

### Demo
- You can [watch a video demo from here](https://youtu.be/bWXRTOnOiE8). The demo shows how to read data input registers of a PLC as a slave device and also how to write data in the PLC Holding registers
